11/24/2017,0,0,1077,FALSE,Recommended,Absolutely love this game!,Dead by Daylight
12/1/2016,0,0,45,FALSE,Recommended,The overall game is pretty good but the bad part is that when i was a beginer i faced people who had full perks and is not fun playing against player who has much more perks then you and also plz make the hooks can not undisable because i had some matchs where all my hooks are gone.,Dead by Daylight
1/24/2017,0,0,24,FALSE,Recommended,Fun game to play with friends.,Dead by Daylight
8/20/2016,0,0,49,FALSE,Recommended,Best scary game i have played in a long time and it is so intense and is so fun to play with friends. This game can be a bit buggy but the game overall is so fun.,Dead by Daylight
12/13/2017,0,0,34,FALSE,Not Recommended,Awesome concept game.Graphics are best killers are only available in DLC (pay2win) and the whole game is riddled with bugs. Like I said the idea is great but it's like the devs put in the least possible effort to make it come to be. Huge disappointment.,Dead by Daylight
6/19/2016,1,1,40,FALSE,Recommended,this game is really fun with friends,Dead by Daylight
9/1/2016,0,0,508,FALSE,Recommended,The game has come along way TLDR Recommended.Description of objectives 1 killer 4 survivors. 4 survivors must powerup 5 generators and leave by one of two exit gates while the killer attempts to hamper progress by sacrificing survivors to "The Entity". Survivors are rewarded for working with each other and aiding in progression to the exit gates. Gameplay is made dynamic through different killers survivors maps and a large assortment of perks to suit your playstyle.Gameplay Very fun to play with friends and a pleasure to play solo as well. You're always a winner whether you successfully escape the killer or not promoting a style of gameplay that almost completely excludes selfish plays (you can't really do much about the purposefully selfish players). Teamwork is essential to survivng this game and with over 200 hours in this game I'm always on edge waiting for the killer to sneak up on me.Servers In a previous iteration of this review I commented on terrible MM which seems to be fixed now. Buying into this game you are not presently getting dedicated servers which means your gameplay is dependent on how good the host's connection is. A lot of the time this isn't a problem and the gameplay is enjoyable,Dead by Daylight
11/20/2016,0,0,1382,FALSE,Not Recommended,This game used to be a lot of fun until recently and here are a few problems that I've noticed (1). The new hunter "The Shade" is faster than the other hunters and is way to op this is imparitive and needs to change immediately. (2). The new map that came with the halloween dlc is small which is fine but they put the same amount of hooks from the other maps in the small map this makes it very hard to not get caught by the hunter. (3). I've noticed that hunters ranging from rank 1 rank 20 have been camping the runners when on the hooks this is making the game not fun anymore. when the hunters are camping they should have a penalty to some degree. (4). The hunters that camp and hook the last person want to get rid of "Survive with Friends" . If this happens then it will almost make the game impossible to play with friends. Please do not get rid of Survive With Friends.Until these changes are met I cannot recommend this game.*Update*Im glad the developers did not get rid of Survive with Friends but 9 out of 10 killers are still camping and it seems that with every single update and "expansion" the devs are making the killers faster and faster also this is a note to the devs "Stop making the killers faster and stop listening to the players that only play killer".,Dead by Daylight
11/6/2017,1,1,1357,FALSE,Recommended,I've been quite addicted to this game after I bought it. The game mechanics are fantastic. It's a hide and seek or be chased game. I would recommend that you play with friends for an organized team play.Ever since the new freddy update players keeps whining about how OP he is especially to lower ranks. The higher ranks don't complain much because they have perks to counter Freddy. My advice to new players is learn to juke each killer look back pallet loop (to buy time if he's tunneling) and 360 his (if you can but won't work against skilled killers). Hope that helps to future players. See you in the fog!,Dead by Daylight
11/30/2017,1,1,329,FALSE,Recommended,Great game fun with friends. Many people complaining about the negative stuff but overall it's really a great game and you're going to be spending a lot of time playing it. Recommended for sure.,Dead by Daylight
7/4/2016,1,1,0,FALSE,Recommended,Very atmospheric great horror game!,Dead by Daylight
6/22/2016,0,0,34,FALSE,Recommended,Dead By Daylight is a great horror game.I bought the deluxe edition the artwork ost and masks for payday were worth the price in my opinion So Now to the real game.So this game was a wonderful horror game.They were great at making us fear the killer.The sudden shocks and the heartbeats makes the game more realistic.Although there are a few stuff that you can use to make the game easier the killer also could use it as well.This game has a fair balance between killers and survivors which is good although the killer is faster and has more senses than survivors killers make noises which makes it obvious for survivors.On the other hand Survivors only make noises if they fail at repairing a generator.The Camera is quite nice with the third and first person thing.Pros Great GameplayMatching Soundtrack Fair Balance of ClassesGood artworkAwesome EnvironmentsGets the 'spooky feel' to the gameCons a few bugsMultiplayer survivors quit easily even in game.No full storyline we only know a bit of each character and none of each killers.Result 9/10The game itself is very interesting yet the bugs and how survivors can quit easily in multiplayer is quite annoying.The story itself isnt too clear yet the great and Terrifying gameplay would make the game worth the price.(voted this for better than expected),Dead by Daylight
8/30/2016,0,0,78,FALSE,Recommended,Great Game,Dead by Daylight
1/31/2017,0,0,3,FALSE,Recommended,Nice Game,Dead by Daylight
1/18/2017,0,0,722,FALSE,Recommended,Great Game!,Dead by Daylight
6/19/2016,0,0,807,FALSE,Recommended,Great game thrilling and you get to scare the crap out of survivors when you play as the killer. What's not to like? Oh right the rank obessed players who would disconnect the moment they get hanged so they could preserve their pips (or whatever). If some kind of penalty was implemented towards curbing such force disconnects that would be great. Pretty much the only gripe I have about this otherwise entertaining game with decent potential. 5/7,Dead by Daylight
1/9/2019,0,0,262,FALSE,Not Recommended,so many glitches and bugs that its unplayable half of the time 0/10,Dead by Daylight
11/22/2018,0,0,257,FALSE,Recommended,Very Fun,Dead by Daylight
2/2/2019,4,118,41,FALSE,Recommended,Excellent spiritual successor to advance warsAlso incredible map/campaign editor you can do so much with it. I recreated Chapter 22 of Fire Emblem Thracia 776 cutscenes and all.,Wargroove
2/2/2019,1,69,9,FALSE,Recommended,Having only played Advance Wars in the past I could not be happier. Fantastic artstyle and design. The music is on another level it never gets boring! Just wish there was a way to play the campaign online co op. Try out this game if you like Fire Emblem or Advance Wars. Thanks for the great game!,Wargroove
2/5/2019,3,53,7,FALSE,Recommended,Games like this make me wish there was a Neutral rating. It has the elements of a great tactics based game but there are very serious pitfalls for it as well. The lack of unit diversity. The game touts having 4 factions but each of them have all the same units just with different sprites so there's no real tactical choice between any of them besides which sprites you like the most and which commander you want to play. Each commander's unique Grooves. These have wildly variable usefulness ranging from putting up a protective barrier in a wide area healing all nearby allied units to occasionally summoning a single version of the lowest tier unit or moving a single generic enemy unit somewhere else in a very wide area on the map. They are all touted as being able to change your tactics completely but because they can only be used every few turns at most they're little more than an occasional bonus if even that. Commanders themselves fall under the same problem as the first point in that they're all generic units with no variance in stats or combat style. This is particularly jarring when you're dealing with commanders who wield magic but can only attack at close range. You have commanders who are obviously mages or soldiers or literally a dog but they all behave like generic Commander units. The fog of war. It's immensely unfair that the fog of war only applies to you. You send a unit or two out forward to scout and suddenly they're surrounded by enemies they couldn't have possibly noticed but who all know where all of your units are at any point in time.It is a VERY GOOD tactics game in the vein of the old Advance Wars games. I personally lean more towards Fire Emblem but I enjoy all tactics games and this with the notable exceptions I've discussed before is an incredibly beautiful and solid game.,Wargroove
2/4/2019,5,66,7,FALSE,Not Recommended,While a good spirit successor to Advance Wars there are simply way to many hard counters (aka insta killing whole units) and not enough soft counters for me to give a positive rating. Spending moderate large amounts of gold only for it to instantly die do to several "counters" in the game heavily encourages reactionary play rather then any form of actual strategy as with current balancing picking the counter to whatever your enemy spawns is more far more effective then anything else. Perhaps in general lowering the damage output of all units by a small margin would fix this issue being able to react to your enemy rather then just rushing counter units to instantly kill whatever the enemy makes.,Wargroove
4/4/2016,1,1,22,TRUE,Recommended,build a great wall and make this factory great again!,Factorio
10/13/2017,1,1,189,TRUE,Recommended,very addicting. If you've ever played feed the beast or tekkit you'll feel right at home. honestly sometimes it feels like some of the items here were inspired by those modpacks.,Factorio
10/16/2017,0,0,11,TRUE,Recommended,What an amazing game!! Really would reccomend this game to everyone.,Factorio
5/18/2016,0,0,541,TRUE,Recommended,One of the great ones.Inspired by resource manager games like Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft Factorio is an industry building RTS that takes the means of production to the extreme. The player is stranded on a hostile alien planet after a botched space colonization attempt. Using furnaces assembly machines an army of machines and more he strikes out against the endless alien swarm in every direction. Yet the biters and spitters are enraged by his factories' pollution and attack from every direction.In a nutshell Excellent RTS resource management game developed by an independent studio based in the EUGreat community though not very largeMultiplayer support still in the works but this should be an excellent game with other peopleWell optimized game runs very wellBig updates in the worksSome downsides Tedious game play essentially this game puts into into an infinite management loop forcing you to continually jump through hoops that force you to expand your production.Poor mod multiplayer support at the time of writing steam workshop and servers have not been integrated into the game's system. It's currently easiest as a single player game.Rating 94/100,Factorio
10/31/2017,0,0,70,TRUE,Recommended,Amazing game. I almost always wait for bundles and sales but this is well worth the price.,Factorio
5/8/2016,0,0,395,TRUE,Recommended,Maybe the most ridiculously entertaining game I have ever played in my 2 decades as a hardcore gamer. The gameplay is silky smooth and it's honestly not super tedious like a lot of other crafting games. It's amazing.,Factorio
4/18/2016,2,1,11,TRUE,Recommended,Just get it. You won't regret this one bit.,Factorio
11/28/2016,0,0,198,TRUE,Recommended,This game deserves a reward. I played it almost since it's beginning and it's still not getting boring.,Factorio
10/26/2017,0,0,1071,TRUE,Recommended,I like it.,Factorio
5/4/2016,2,1,88,TRUE,Recommended,Ever play tekkit or feed the beast in your life? Remember the addiction of building huge factories to automate production of things and feeling accomplished in it?Welcome to factorio a game where you can really do what you wish as it is a sandbox with no real story (unless you play the campain) and a major learning curve. Once you got the basics down prepare your because biters will try and penetrate your every night and as your pollution goes up from the massive factory you made that just makes them want you more ( ?? ). BUT WAIT THERES MORE! You just ran out of recourses so you are butt ed untill you get a train system up to ship materials back to your hub base. Once you think you beat all the biters and mobs and resupplied your base you discovered that OH WAIT the biters can rellocate if you don't commit genocide on them. Fun.I seriously recommend this game to anyone who lives for automation and building factories / management and layouts. This is low graphically so my intel pentium from 1987 which cant run fucing donky kong country could run this flawlessly.Tl dr A game about making factorys to automate everything and fending from mobs.I recommend this to everyone,Factorio
12/22/2018,0,0,38,FALSE,Recommended,Really fun game. Fast to just jump in a game and have fun for a while when you feel like it.,Insurgency: Sandstorm
1/2/2019,0,0,18,FALSE,Recommended,Great game still work to do but LOTS of potential,Insurgency: Sandstorm
1/3/2019,0,0,81,FALSE,Recommended,Great game great devs,Insurgency: Sandstorm
12/22/2018,0,0,7,FALSE,Recommended,Best team based realistic tactical fps game on the market!,Insurgency: Sandstorm
12/27/2018,0,0,22,FALSE,Recommended,Very Very nice game but has a few bug and when i say "a few" i mean alot granted these will prbally be fixed in the future they still get anoying such as weapons not loading maps not loading losing connection as soon as i join a game poor optimazation etc etc. anyway great game greatmechanics good community love it so far!,Insurgency: Sandstorm
12/22/2018,0,0,23,FALSE,Recommended,Good game !,Insurgency: Sandstorm
12/26/2018,0,0,52,FALSE,Recommended,This game is instantly addictive. Bought it for myself on Christmas and played 10 hours. If you played the first Insurgency you'll love this game. Gunplay feels very satisfying and it feels like you're carrying around a Howitzer. Gameplay is challenging and the fast time to kill and time to death makes succeeding in tense situations even more validating. Perfect 5/7,Insurgency: Sandstorm
12/22/2018,0,0,61,FALSE,Recommended,SO MUCH FUN. I've been playing this for about 4 days now and i can't stop. It feels fresh to me and that's a long awaited feeling. The guns are easily customizable the enemy AI isn't complete trash and the objectives are straight forward. I haven't had this much fun playing a game since PUBG first came out in 2017 so it's been a while since i'vebeen able to say that i truely enjoy this game. If you like FPS with a good challenge try this out. The only things i can think of that need improvement are that it doesn't seem well optimised even for my RTX 2080 which seems like it should be able to handle this at 1440p on the highest settings but oh well. If you have anything below a 1070 tuirn the effects all the way down shadows down foliage to medium and you should have a really good experience at 1080p and 1440p.,Insurgency: Sandstorm
12/26/2018,0,0,69,FALSE,Recommended,This is one of the best shooters I've ever played. I've always felt like Arma modded pvp is the gold standard in tense/heartpounding firefights with other players that will make you jump in your seat when someone fires a round at you and make you feel insanely good when you kill someone. Gunfights feel heartpoundingly tense like they do In pvp Arma. For anyone coming from Battlefield I can tell you that this game manages to provide that intense shooting experience at higher levels than Battlefield 5 and it does this with fewer accoutrements than what Battlefield puts on the maps (tanks planes etc.). Insurgency does have air support but it works much differently than other games like BF. Suffice it to say it's well implemented and balanced and it adds lots of intensity to the experience.Every gunfight feels intense. Your aim is truly important in this game but even more so is your reaction time. I am not knocking Battlefield or COD or doing any of that kind of childish "my game is better than yours" kind of bs. But in my opinion this is the game you want to play if you like a hardcore game focused on teamwork skill and intense close quarters combat.One important thing for me is that all guns gear etc. are unlocked from the beginning. You don't have to grind for weeks like in other games to unlock that weapon that everyone else who got there first is using to mow you down. Nope just pick your loadout and go. The currency you earn for playing the game is used to buy cosmetics for your character.There is no killcam (thank god). The game intentionally lacks some things like ammo count in your mag to focus the experience more to the hardcore. Be mindful of when to reload. Be mindful of whether or not you've even loaded a mag in the magwell. I love the fact that if you start reloading and then immediately start doing something else like climbing over a ledge or sprinting you will not load the mag in and you will need to leave some time to actually put a mag in at some point. Features like this make the experience feel hardcore and authentic. It's features like this that make the experience feel deep. Reloading a mag in the heat of things is a serious decision. Pulling out your grenade to throw it in a tight spot is a serious decision. Everything you do feels important to your success.Lastly I have to point out how amazing the sound is in this game. Earlier I stated that this game provides that feeling of a big battlefield fight but it does so without all the tanks and planes and stuff that a game like BF has. It does this with some of the best sound effects in a shooter I've ever heard. Prepare your ears because things that should be loud and deafening are loud and defeaning. When things are quiet you will hear footsteps around you. When explosions are going off and there is mass confusion you will understand what I am talking about with the sound design. Every sound effect in this game is on point.This game is well worth the price if you're looking for a very tight shooting experience. If you've never played something like this it will feel difficult at first but stick it out. This game will reward your patience in learning the maps learning how to move and when to push or hold position and learning the gun recoil etc. etc.,Insurgency: Sandstorm
1/3/2019,0,0,38,FALSE,Recommended,pretty damn good,Insurgency: Sandstorm
12/27/2018,0,0,53,FALSE,Recommended,Best multiplayer shooter I have played in a long time. Combines realism with arcade style shooting mechanics perfectly. Loadout balances are great and the tactical nature of the game shines in every game mode. I cannot recomend enough especially for the price.,Insurgency: Sandstorm
1/4/2019,0,0,25,FALSE,Recommended,Awesome game! So glad they kept the good stuff from Insurgency. Wish that the joining game as party worked better but it is still early days so sure it will be addressed.,Insurgency: Sandstorm
1/4/2019,0,0,98,FALSE,Recommended,Very Fun and enjoyable to play.,Insurgency: Sandstorm
12/30/2018,0,0,57,FALSE,Not Recommended,This is not a bad game. I just cannot recommend it in its current state. After already extending the beta once it is still full of bugs and feels like it is missing features. The game is getting updated so it might get better but as it stands the first game is just better than this unfortunately.,Insurgency: Sandstorm
1/12/2019,0,0,34,FALSE,Recommended,A very good game it just needs A LOT of optimization.,Insurgency: Sandstorm
1/23/2019,0,0,42,FALSE,Recommended,First Impressions. It seems that with every incarnation of the Insurgency brand it loses part of what made the original mod great. This time it seems that the interface has been crippled to cater to console players. It still feels like a better game than any of the triple A releases this year. WIll update my review once I have 10+ hours in the game.,Insurgency: Sandstorm
