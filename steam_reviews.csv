11/24/2017,0,0,1077,FALSE,Recommended,Absolutely love this game!,Dead by Daylight
12/1/2016,0,0,45,FALSE,Recommended,The overall game is pretty good but the bad part is that when i was a beginer i faced people who had full perks and is not fun playing against player who has much more perks then you and also plz make the hooks can not undisable because i had some matchs where all my hooks are gone.,Dead by Daylight
1/24/2017,0,0,24,FALSE,Recommended,Fun game to play with friends.,Dead by Daylight
8/20/2016,0,0,49,FALSE,Recommended,Best scary game i have played in a long time and it is so intense and is so fun to play with friends. This game can be a bit buggy but the game overall is so fun.,Dead by Daylight
12/13/2017,0,0,34,FALSE,Not Recommended,Awesome concept game.Graphics are best killers are only available in DLC (pay2win) and the whole game is riddled with bugs. Like I said the idea is great but it's like the devs put in the least possible effort to make it come to be. Huge disappointment.,Dead by Daylight
6/19/2016,1,1,40,FALSE,Recommended,this game is really fun with friends,Dead by Daylight
9/1/2016,0,0,508,FALSE,Recommended,The game has come along way TLDR Recommended.Description of objectives 1 killer 4 survivors. 4 survivors must powerup 5 generators and leave by one of two exit gates while the killer attempts to hamper progress by sacrificing survivors to "The Entity". Survivors are rewarded for working with each other and aiding in progression to the exit gates. Gameplay is made dynamic through different killers survivors maps and a large assortment of perks to suit your playstyle.Gameplay Very fun to play with friends and a pleasure to play solo as well. You're always a winner whether you successfully escape the killer or not promoting a style of gameplay that almost completely excludes selfish plays (you can't really do much about the purposefully selfish players). Teamwork is essential to survivng this game and with over 200 hours in this game I'm always on edge waiting for the killer to sneak up on me.Servers In a previous iteration of this review I commented on terrible MM which seems to be fixed now. Buying into this game you are not presently getting dedicated servers which means your gameplay is dependent on how good the host's connection is. A lot of the time this isn't a problem and the gameplay is enjoyable,Dead by Daylight
11/20/2016,0,0,1382,FALSE,Not Recommended,This game used to be a lot of fun until recently and here are a few problems that I've noticed (1). The new hunter "The Shade" is faster than the other hunters and is way to op this is imparitive and needs to change immediately. (2). The new map that came with the halloween dlc is small which is fine but they put the same amount of hooks from the other maps in the small map this makes it very hard to not get caught by the hunter. (3). I've noticed that hunters ranging from rank 1 rank 20 have been camping the runners when on the hooks this is making the game not fun anymore. when the hunters are camping they should have a penalty to some degree. (4). The hunters that camp and hook the last person want to get rid of "Survive with Friends" . If this happens then it will almost make the game impossible to play with friends. Please do not get rid of Survive With Friends.Until these changes are met I cannot recommend this game.*Update*Im glad the developers did not get rid of Survive with Friends but 9 out of 10 killers are still camping and it seems that with every single update and "expansion" the devs are making the killers faster and faster also this is a note to the devs "Stop making the killers faster and stop listening to the players that only play killer".,Dead by Daylight
11/6/2017,1,1,1357,FALSE,Recommended,I've been quite addicted to this game after I bought it. The game mechanics are fantastic. It's a hide and seek or be chased game. I would recommend that you play with friends for an organized team play.Ever since the new freddy update players keeps whining about how OP he is especially to lower ranks. The higher ranks don't complain much because they have perks to counter Freddy.,Dead by Daylight
11/30/2017,1,1,329,FALSE,Recommended,Great game fun with friends. Many people complaining about the negative stuff but overall it's really a great game and you're going to be spending a lot of time playing it. Recommended for sure.,Dead by Daylight
7/4/2016,1,1,0,FALSE,Recommended,Very atmospheric great horror game!,Dead by Daylight
6/22/2016,0,0,34,FALSE,Recommended,Dead By Daylight is a great horror game.I bought the deluxe edition the artwork ost and masks for payday were worth the price in my opinion So Now to the real game.So this game was a wonderful horror game.They were great at making us fear the killer.The sudden shocks and the heartbeats makes the game more realistic.Although there are a few stuff that you can use to make the game easier the killer also could use it as well.This game has a fair balance between killers and survivors which is good although the killer is faster and has more senses than survivors killers make noises which makes it obvious for survivors.,Dead by Daylight
8/30/2016,0,0,78,FALSE,Recommended,Great Game,Dead by Daylight
1/31/2017,0,0,3,FALSE,Recommended,Nice Game,Dead by Daylight
1/18/2017,0,0,722,FALSE,Recommended,Great Game!,Dead by Daylight
6/19/2016,0,0,807,FALSE,Recommended,Great game thrilling and you get to scare the crap out of survivors when you play as the killer. What's not to like? Oh right the rank obessed players who would disconnect the moment they get hanged so they could preserve their pips (or whatever). If some kind of penalty was implemented towards curbing such force disconnects that would be great. Pretty much the only gripe I have about this otherwise entertaining game with decent potential. 5/7,Dead by Daylight
1/9/2019,0,0,262,FALSE,Not Recommended,so many glitches and bugs that its unplayable half of the time 0/10,Dead by Daylight
11/22/2018,0,0,257,FALSE,Recommended,Very Fun,Dead by Daylight
2/2/2019,4,118,41,FALSE,Recommended,Excellent spiritual successor to advance warsAlso incredible map/campaign editor you can do so much with it. I recreated Chapter 22 of Fire Emblem Thracia 776 cutscenes and all.,Wargroove
2/2/2019,1,69,9,FALSE,Recommended,Having only played Advance Wars in the past I could not be happier. Fantastic artstyle and design. The music is on another level it never gets boring! Just wish there was a way to play the campaign online co op. Try out this game if you like Fire Emblem or Advance Wars. Thanks for the great game!,Wargroove
2/5/2019,3,53,7,FALSE,Recommended,Games like this make me wish there was a Neutral rating. It has the elements of a great tactics based game but there are very serious pitfalls for it as well. The lack of unit diversity. The game touts having 4 factions but each of them have all the same units just with different sprites so there's no real tactical choice between any of them besides which sprites you like the most and which commander you want to play. Each commander's unique Grooves.,Wargroove
2/4/2019,5,66,7,FALSE,Not Recommended,While a good spirit successor to Advance Wars there are simply way to many hard counters (aka insta killing whole units) and not enough soft counters for me to give a positive rating. Spending moderate large amounts of gold only for it to instantly die do to several "counters" in the game heavily encourages reactionary play rather then any form of actual strategy as with current balancing picking the counter to whatever your enemy spawns is more far more effective then anything else. Perhaps in general lowering the damage output of all units by a small margin would fix this issue being able to react to your enemy rather then just rushing counter units to instantly kill whatever the enemy makes.,Wargroove
4/4/2016,1,1,22,TRUE,Recommended,build a great wall and make this factory great again!,Factorio
10/13/2017,1,1,189,TRUE,Recommended,very addicting. If you've ever played feed the beast or tekkit you'll feel right at home. honestly sometimes it feels like some of the items here were inspired by those modpacks.,Factorio
10/16/2017,0,0,11,TRUE,Recommended,What an amazing game!! Really would reccomend this game to everyone.,Factorio
5/18/2016,0,0,541,TRUE,Recommended,One of the great ones.Inspired by resource manager games like Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft Factorio is an industry building RTS that takes the means of production to the extreme. The player is stranded on a hostile alien planet after a botched space colonization attempt. Using furnaces assembly machines an army of machines and more he strikes out against the endless alien swarm in every direction. Yet the biters and spitters are enraged by his factories' pollution and attack from every direction.,Factorio
10/31/2017,0,0,70,TRUE,Recommended,Amazing game. I almost always wait for bundles and sales but this is well worth the price.,Factorio
5/8/2016,0,0,395,TRUE,Recommended,Maybe the most ridiculously entertaining game I have ever played in my 2 decades as a hardcore gamer. The gameplay is silky smooth and it's honestly not super tedious like a lot of other crafting games. It's amazing.,Factorio
4/18/2016,2,1,11,TRUE,Recommended,Just get it. You won't regret this one bit.,Factorio
11/28/2016,0,0,198,TRUE,Recommended,This game deserves a reward. I played it almost since it's beginning and it's still not getting boring.,Factorio
10/26/2017,0,0,1071,TRUE,Recommended,I like it.,Factorio
5/4/2016,2,1,88,TRUE,Recommended,Ever play tekkit or feed the beast in your life? Remember the addiction of building huge factories to automate production of things and feeling accomplished in it?Welcome to factorio a game where you can really do what you wish as it is a sandbox with no real story (unless you play the campain) and a major learning curve. Once you got the basics down prepare your because biters will try and penetrate your every night and as your pollution goes up from the massive factory you made that just makes them want you more ( ?? ).,Factorio
